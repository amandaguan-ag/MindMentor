# Capstone Proposal

## Name of Student:
Amanda Guan

## Name of Project:
AI Voicebot Mental Consultant

---

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
The AI Voicebot Mental Consultant aims to provide immediate, personalized mental health support to individuals in need. The voicebot will engage users in conversation, offering empathy, guidance, and resources tailored to their specific mental well-being needs. 

---

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

1. Voice Interaction: Enable natural and empathetic voice interaction with users.
2. Mental Health Assessment: Basic assessment of the user's mental state through conversation and predefined questions.
3. Resource Recommendation: Provide appropriate resources, such as articles, videos, or contact information for professionals, based on the user's needs.
4. Privacy and Security: Ensure all interactions are confidential and comply with relevant privacy regulations.

---

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries for understanding and responding to user input.
- Voice Recognition and Synthesis libraries for human-like voice interaction.
- React for building the user interface if there's a web component.
- FastAPI for handling backend requests and managing data.
- OpenAI API for leveraging pre-trained models for conversation.
- Secure Data Encryption libraries to maintain user privacy and confidentiality.

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

1. Multilingual Support: Implementing additional languages to make the voicebot accessible to non-English speakers.
2. Integration with Wearable Devices: To monitor physiological signs that may correlate with mental states (e.g., heart rate).
3. Advanced Personalization: Utilizing machine learning to adapt and personalize responses over time.
4. Professional Network Integration: Enabling direct connections to mental health professionals for immediate support if needed.
5. Community Building: Creating a supportive community platform where users can share experiences and support each other, moderated by the AI.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Translation APIs for multilingual support.
- SDKs for wearable device integration.
- Machine Learning libraries for advanced personalization.
- APIs for professional network integration.
- Community moderation tools for the community platform.
